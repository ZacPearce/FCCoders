# Coders Football Club

## A responsive website for a local football team to show the user the history of the club, why it's important to the local community, to build a bigger fanbase and recruit new players for the team.

# Business Goal

- ### Increase Public Interaction

I aim to do this by offering open trials to the public regardless of age, gender or ability. Fill out the application form on the join us page and you will be directed to the appropriate team. It will be a fun day out with a lot of photo opportunities and good publicity in the local news and social media.

- ### Bring More Fans to Games

I believe we will achieve this by giving out free season tickets to all participants in the open trial. Even if they aren't successful it will put bums in seats, and if they are successful we will get a player to improve our team to help us become successful on the pitch, either way it's a win win because it helps the team grow.

# UX (User Experience)

The User will be able to easily navigate through the site, whether they want to check out what the club is about, do some research on the club's history, see the facilities of the club via the photo gallery or sign up for the club's open trial, it is all easy to find and can be accessed without any issues.

They can find all relevant information needed to get in touch with us or allow them to just search through the site and find out about us.

# Design

For the design I incorporated the club colours of midnight blue, gold and white into the site. I used the same colours throughout the site to keep in line with the theme of the colour scheme without it being too overbearing.

# Typography

### *Kanit*
 I used Kanit for the body of the site as I feel it's welcoming, easy to read and easy on the eye. 

### *Arial*
I used  Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif for the articles as it is neutral and easy to read and slightly different to Kanit so it may catch your eye and make you want to read.

# Structure


## Header

- In the header of each page I have gave the page a unique title and I've hyperlinked our club mascot 'the warthog' next to the title as a return to home button.

## Home Page

- You're welcomed to the page with a smile, the hero image is our home pitch but styled into a smiley face to make it more welcoming.

- Above the hero image, there's a welcome sign with a navigation bar to all our pages.

- Underneath the hero image, I've made a simple design that gives you all the information on our club ethos, what we believe to be important and staples of the club, without making the information too overwhelming off the jump.

- After the club ethos I've put a link to the join us page to promote our open trial, the more people who sign up the better.

## Gallery

- I've made a gallery page of our top pictures of the week, I plan on doing a weekly update to give users a reasons to return to the site regularly.  

- The gallery also gives the user an insight of what it looks like to play for us, the quality of the pitches we play on and a few pictures of the players so they can become more familiar with our club as a whole.

## History

- I have created a history page for the users who want to know more about the very rich and unique history of the club.

- Photos of the club founder with his compelling story that will take you through an emotional rollercoaster and will hopefully have you wanting to be a part of our wonderful legacy.

- I've also added some our club's records with the name, picture and achievement of the record holder in the section underneath. Currently we are showing the club legends who hold the records for most goals, assists and appearances, as I feel recogniction for achievements can inspire people to try and break the records.

## Join Us

- To achieve our business goals, I feel like this is the most important page, as we need people to sign up for the open trial.

- I've put a statement at the top of the page with an eye catching design telling you how to join, the next steps and the benefits of trying out, which is a free season ticket.

- I've put a simple and easy to fill out application form on the page asking you all the information we need to send you the relevant information about the open trial.

- There's a schedule to show when we are training and which of our teams are training (Mens, Womens, under 18s teams and the youth academy). We show you what time training is and what days we play our games.

- An image of a young boy with a football is there for aesthic as it looks inspiring and might subconsciously encourage people who are on the fence to take a leap of faith and sign up.

- A map has been placed at the bottom of the page to show our location of where our facilities are.

## Footer

- I've linked our social media pages for 'Facebook', 'X' (formerly known as twitter), 'Instagram' and 'Youtube' all in the footer and made sure they remain at the bottom of the page regardless of which webpage you're on.

- I feel like social media is a crucial part of the club's growth in this day and age, if we go viral it will really help the growth of the club via endorsement deals as well as new interest in the club.
