                    <p class="text-box">
                        In 1904 a man named Theophilus Coders had the only warthog farm in the UK. With Coders being an avid football fan he used to dribble a ball around the farm as the warthogs would chase him trying to get the ball. One day Coders woke up to see all the warthogs on his farm, running around and dribbling the ball with their snouts on the ground. Coders sat on his porch and watched his warthogs play football amongst themselves every day and they got good. Real good. So good that he set up a goal and the warthogs quickly learned the aim of the game. They got so good that Mr. Coders started to charge people to come and see the warthogs play every Sunday after church, he then progressed to selling season tickets and by 1908 Theophilus Coders had 500 people coming to watch his warthogs play every Sunday. In 1916 the farm was bombed during world war 1, killing the warthogs and leaving Theophilus Coders with one leg and a broken heart. Mr Coders went into a deep depression and took his life 2 days before the war finished, the news spread around the town like wildfire and everybody came to pay their respects. The town decided to rebuild the farm and transform it into a football club in honour of Theophilus Coders and his mighty warthogs.
                        Giving us Coders FC aka the Mighty Warthogs, without you we are nothing.
